# AtlasPay Business Continuity Plan & Organizational Risk Profile
**Overview**

This project documents a complete Business Continuity Plan and organizational Risk Profile for a simulated FinTech payment processor (AtlasPay). The objective was to evaluate operational resilience, identify critical business functions, define recovery priorities, and establish a governance‑aligned continuity strategy that supports executive decision‑making and long‑term organizational stability. Rather than focusing solely on technical recovery, this work emphasizes business impact, process dependencies, and risk‑informed continuity planning.

**Technologies & Tools Used**

- Microsoft Word (BCP documentation, process analysis, impact statements)
- Microsoft Excel (risk profile scoring, criticality matrix, dependency mapping)
- NIST SP 800‑34 Rev. 1 (Contingency Planning Guide)
- NIST SP 800‑53 Rev. 5 (control alignment for continuity & resilience)
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA) methodology
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO) & Recovery Point Objective (RPO) modeling

**Deliverable Features**

- Full Business Continuity Plan aligned with NIST guidance
- Organizational Risk Profile summarizing key operational and security risks
- Business Impact Analysis with critical process identification
- RTO/RPO definitions for essential functions
- Dependency mapping across systems, vendors, and personnel
- Continuity strategies and recovery procedures
- Executive‑ready summary for governance and oversight
- Clear roles, responsibilities, and escalation pathways

**Notes for Reviewers**

This BCP and Risk Profile were intentionally written in accessible, business‑focused language to support executive understanding and operational ownership. While aligned with NIST frameworks, the emphasis is on clarity, practicality, and decision support rather than technical depth. The structure mirrors real‑world continuity documentation used in regulated industries such as FinTech and financial services.

**Process (Start to Finish)**

The project began by defining scope, critical business functions, and continuity objectives. A Business Impact Analysis was conducted to identify essential processes, required resources, and acceptable downtime thresholds. Dependencies including systems, vendors, and personnel were mapped to understand operational risk concentration.

A Risk Profile was developed using a quantitative scoring model to evaluate operational, security, and third‑party risks affecting continuity. RTOs and RPOs were assigned based on business impact, and continuity strategies were designed to ensure recoverability within acceptable thresholds. The final deliverable includes governance structure, communication plans, and recovery procedures tailored to the AtlasPay environment.

**Key Takeaways & Discoveries**

- Continuity planning is most effective when tied directly to business impact, not just IT recovery.
- Clear RTO/RPO definitions drive realistic expectations and resource prioritization.
- Dependencies; especially third‑party services represent major continuity risks.
- A strong BCP requires both governance structure and practical, actionable procedures.
- Risk profiling strengthens continuity planning by highlighting where resilience investments matter most.

**Deep Dive: Why the Risk Profile Matters**

The Risk Profile provides a consolidated view of operational and security risks that could disrupt critical business functions. When paired with the BCP, it enables leadership to understand not only how to recover, but which risks most threaten continuity and where mitigation efforts should be focused. This integration elevates continuity planning from a compliance exercise to a strategic resilience function.

**Value to Operational Resilience & Risk Management**

This project demonstrates how structured continuity planning and risk profiling support organizational resilience, regulatory expectations, and executive decision‑making. It highlights the importance of aligning continuity strategies with business impact, governance requirements, and realistic operational constraints.

**Growth & Next Improvements**

This project strengthened my ability to analyze operational dependencies, model business impact, and design governance‑aligned continuity strategies. Future enhancements may include:

- Integration with GRC platforms for automated continuity tracking
- Tabletop exercise documentation and after‑action reporting
- Expanded vendor dependency analysis
- Development of disaster recovery (DR) technical runbooks
